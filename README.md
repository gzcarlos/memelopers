# memelopers

Here you can checkout some helper files from the memelopers project thing i'm working on

more specifically:

- gruntfile.js
	I use grunt to run jshint, minify all assets(css, js, html) and make the publish of the app

- package.json
	The packages that grunt uses

- .htaccess
	I use it to force an http connection, make the url look pretty and add headers for expiration dates

- manifest.json
	That's for when i implement the serviceworker, with it the users will be prompted to install a shortcut to the webapp if the use chrome from mobile
